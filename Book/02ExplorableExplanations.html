    <h2>Computer Programming Brings Complex Thought to the Masses</h2>
    <p><p><em>Omni:</em> Does that limit the number of people who can contribute, or even understand what's being done?</p>
    <p>Feynman: Or else somebody will develop a way of thinking about the problems so that we can understand them more easily. Maybe they'll just teach it earlier and earlier. You know, it's not true that what is called "abstruse" math is so difficult. Take something like computer programming, and the careful logic needed for that--the kind of thinking that mama and papa would have said was only for professors. Well, now it's part of a lot of daily activities, it's a way to make a living; their children get interested and get hold of a computer and they're doing the most crazy, wonderful things!</p>
    <p><em>Omni:</em>...with ads for programming schools on every matchbook!</p>
    <p>Feynman: Right. I don't believe in the idea that there are a few peculiar people capable of understanding math, and the rest of the world is normal. Math is a human discovery, and it's no more complicated than humans can understand. I had a calculus book once that said, "What one fool can do, another can." What we've been able to work out about nature may look abstract and threatening to someone who hasn't studied it, but it was fools who did it, and in the next generation, all fools will understand it.</p></p>

    <h2>Programming as the Fifth Discipline</h2>
    <p><b>Seibel:</b> You mention four disciplines: music, graphics, mathematics, and text those are about as old as humanity. Clearly there are powerful ideas there that are independent of computers—the computer just provides a way to explore them that might be hard without the computer. Is there also a set of interesting, powerful ideas inherent in the computer? Is programming or computer science another deep discipline—a fifth area we can only do we have computers? </p>

    <p><b>Ingalls:</b> Yes, I think that's what I am getting at The curriculum I've always envisioned is one in which you start with one of these and maybe from the motivation of going deep In one of those areas, you move over to one of the other ones that's less familiar and do a similar thing there. And a lesson to be learned is that the way in which you get to those simpler, deeper structures that generate that whole field is similar in every case.</p>

    <p>There's an algebra of graphics. It's primitive objects,  superposition translation, rotation. Dr music. It's notes and temporal sequences and chords—same thing. And I think this goes "back to seeing how the wind works and how the planets move. It's an invitation to go down and find out how things work and learn in the things that make up the algebra—the processes and the primitive things. So yes, that fifth area, as you call it is just what's common about all of these things.</p>
