    <h1>Copy-Paste Programming</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Number Spiral Example: something clicked seeing this mandela.</li>
        <li>I needed logic to space my numbers around a circle in 12 lines, so I found a clock face.</li>
        <li>Coding can be like putting legos together.</li>
        <li>Coding is an extremely collaborative endeavor.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Remember full stack? No one knew the whole stack.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Finding What You Need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Evaluating Apps: do you need to register to see it? You don't need it. Do you need to download and install it? You don't need it.</li>
        <li>Teachers need specificity and granularity. Small apps that do the one thing they need right now and just that one thing.</li>
        <li>The World Wide Web is a resource shared by X Billion people. Someone out there has had your idea and has already written the code for it or something like it.</li>
        <li>Not going to provide lists of links in this text, because they will just go dead (link rot)
        <li>Instead, I will teach you how to find what you need.</li>
    </ul>
