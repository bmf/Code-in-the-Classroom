    <h1>Coding on the Stack of Giants</h1>

    <p>According to the International Telecommunications Union, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage#Internet_users">3.2 <b>billion</b></a> human minds on the World Wide Web in 2015.</p>

    <p>Noosphere. Memes.</p>

    <h3>Obama Describes the World Wide Web</h3>

    <blockquote>
      The image was mesmerizing, more organic than mechanical, as if I were glimpsing the early stages of some accelerating evolutionary process, in which all the boundaries between men--nationality, race, religion, wealth--were rendered invisible and irrelevant, so that the physicist in Cambridge, the bond trader in Tokyo, the student in a remote Indian village, and the manager of a Mexico City department store were drawn into a single constant, thrumming conversation, time and space giving way to a world spun entirely of light.

    <h2>Putting Code Together Like Legos</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Number Spiral Example: something clicked seeing this mandela.</li>
        <li>I needed logic to space my numbers around a circle in 12 lines, so I found a clock face.</li>
        <li>Coding can be like putting legos together.</li>
        <li>Coding is an extremely collaborative endeavor.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Remember full stack? No one knew the whole stack.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Finding What You Need</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Evaluating Apps: do you need to register to see it? You don't need it. Do you need to download and install it? You don't need it.</li>
        <li>Teachers need specificity and granularity. Small apps that do the one thing they need right now and just that one thing.</li>
        <li>The World Wide Web is a resource shared by X Billion people. Someone out there has had your idea and has already written the code for it or something like it.</li>
        <li>Not going to provide lists of links in this text, because they will just go dead (link rot)
        <li>Instead, I will teach you how to find what you need.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Douglas Crockford on Reading Code</h2>
    <blockquote>
    One of the things I've been pushing is reading. I think that is the most useful thing that a community of programmers can do for each other—spend time on a regular basis reading each other's code. Then are's a tendency in project management just to let the programmers go off independently and then we have the big merge and if it builds then we ship it and we're done and we forget about it.

    <h3>Internet-Access as an Ethical Issue</h3>

    <p>The science fiction author William Gibson is often <a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/01/24/future-has-arrived/">credited</a> with observing, "<em>The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.</em>"</p>

    <p>Internet access is a moral issue for the Information Age. We should have 7 billion minds online. Not only is it wrong to deprive nearly 4 Billion of our fellow human beings the enducational and enlightenment opportunities www access provides, but we are also depriving ourselves of the additional unique perspectives, -----, and sheer brain power that will come with putting the whole world online.</p>
