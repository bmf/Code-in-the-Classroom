    <h2>Experiment</h2>
    <p><b>Brad Fitzpatrick on What Makes a Great Programmer: Think Like a Scientist</b></p>
    <blockquote>
      Thinking like a scientist; changing one thing at a time. Patience and trying to understand the root cause of things. Especially when you're debugging something or designing something that's not quite working. I've seen young programmers say, "Oh, shit, it doesn't work," and then rewrite it all. Stop. Try to figure out what's going on. Learn how to write things incrementally so that at each stage you could verify it.

    <p><b>Spend 20 Percent of Your Time Learning New Things</b></p>
    <blockquote>
      Joe Armstrong: Hamming said, "I always spend a day a week learning new stuff. That means I spend 20 percent more of my time than my colleagues learning new stuff. Now 20 percent at compound interest means that after four and a half years I will know twice as much as them. And because of compound interest, this 20 percent extra, one day a week, after five years I will know three times as much," or whatever the figures are. And I think that's very true. Because I do research I don't spend 20 percent of my time thinking about new stuff, I spend 40 percent of my time thinking about new stuff. And I've done it for 30 years. So I've noticed that I know a lot of stuff. When I get pulled in as a troubleshooter, boom, do it that way, do it that way. You were asking earlier what should one do to become a better programmer? Spend 20 percent of your time learning stuff—because it's compounded.

    <p><b>Research Subjects Expand Naturally on Their Own</b></p>
    <blockquote>
      Once you start the mill turning then computer science is very fractal—almost everything turns out to be interesting, because the subject grows ahead of you. It's not like a fixed thing that's there that you've got to discover. It just expands.

    <h2>Kill Your Darlings</h2>
    <p>Don't Get Attached to Your Code</p>
    <blockquote>
      George Malamidis taught me something about code attachment a few years ago: You always gain by allowing someone to show you an alternative solution. If someone wants to solve a problem in a different way, there are several gains to be had. If their way is inferior, you have an opportunity to mentor a team-mate. If their way is equally elegant, you've gained another solution, or point of view that may be superior in the future. If their way is superior you learn something new and the codebase improves. In exchange for these gains you only need to give up time. Time is valuable, but it's also well spent on improving the ability of a team-mate or your personal ability.
