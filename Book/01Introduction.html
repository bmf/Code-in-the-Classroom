    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <h2>Define the Problem</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Hour of code. Facebook quote.</li>
        <li>I disagree, and so do many programmers.</li>
        <li>I’m not going to push the “Coding is the New Literacy” meme here, because I don’t think it is. Students who don’t learn programming will not...</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Break Down the Problem</h2>

    <p>Smaller components of the problem here.</p>

    <h2>Propose the Solution</h2>

    <p>Bring code into the classroom.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Code belongs in the classroom alongside {classroom tools}]</li>
        <li]>Code belongs in the classroom because code is beautiful. The exercise of programming puts the mind in a state of...</li>
        <li>Coding encourages experimentation, trial and error.</li>
        <li>Just because software and applications are free “as in beer” They are still expensive in time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Jamie Zawinski on Different Kinds of Programming</h2>
    <blockquote>
        There's obviously different kinds of programming. Without people who are not like me none of this would exist. But I've always seen much more in common with writing prose than math. It feels like you're writing a story and you're trying to express a concept to a very dumb person-the computer—who has a limited vocabulary. You've got this concept you want to express and limited tools to express it with. What words do you use and what does your I thing. (<a href="http://mxplx.com/meme/444/">source</a>)

    <h2>L Peter Deutsch: Everyone Will Need to Become Computer Literate in the Future</h2>
    <blockquote>
        You know the old story about the telephone and the telephone operators? The story is. sometime fairly early in the adoption of the telephone, when it was clear that use of the telephone was just expanding at an incredible rate, more and more people were having to be hired to work as operators because we didn't have dial telephones. Someone extrapolated the growth rate and said, "My God. By 20 or years from now, every single person will have to be a telephone operator." Well, that's what happened. I think something like that may be happening in some big areas of programming, as well. (<a href="http://mxplx.com/meme/458/">source</a>)
