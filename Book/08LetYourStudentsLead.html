    <h1>Rely on Your Digital Natives</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>All code should be made available to your students. Let them play with it, change the variables and logic.</li>
        <li>Be Humble: accept that your students may know more than you, give up control</li>
        <li>Our children should grow up to be smarter than we are. Rely on their smarts.</li>
        <li>outsource your coding to your students. Extra credit, substitute software for another project.</li>
        <li>You Don’t need to understand the student’s code, you only need to verify its inputs and outputs. Treat their code like a black box.</li>
        <li>Give students business requirements or you write the pseudo code and have them figure out the programming syntax to implement it.</li>
        <li>Code they write is reusable. Come up with new interactive ideas. Have your students enhance or modify last year’s student project.</li>
        <li>Troubleshooting: StackOverflow.com let the experts troubleshoot your studen’ts code.</li>
        <li>Warning: SO has a policy to not help with homework. So, as the teacher, you will need to post the code (with your students’ help).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Guy Steele on Programming as Magic</h2>
    <p><p>I think it's not an accident that we often use the imagery of magic to describe programming. We speak of computing Wizards and we think of things happening by magic or automagically. And I think that's because being able to get a machine to do what you want is the closest thing we've got in technology to adolescent wish-fulfillment. </p>

    <p>And if you look at the fairy tales, people want to be able to just think in their minds what they want, wave their hands, and it happens. And of course the fairy tales are full of cautionary tales where you forgot to cover the edge case and then something bad happens.</p></p>
