    <h1>Let Your Students Lead / Rely on Your Digital Natives</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>All code should be made available to your students. Let them play with it, change the variables and logic.</li>
        <li>Be Humble: accept that your students may know more than you, give up control</li>
        <li>Our children should grow up to be smarter than we are. Rely on their smarts.</li>
        <li>outsource your coding to your students. Extra credit, substitute software for another project.</li>
        <li>You Don’t need to understand the student’s code, you only need to verify its inputs and outputs. Treat their code like a black box.</li>
        <li>Give students business requirements or you write the pseudo code and have them figure out the programming syntax to implement it.</li>
        <li>Code they write is reusable. Come up with new interactive ideas. Have your students enhance or modify last year’s student project.</li>
        <li>Troubleshooting: StackOverflow.com let the experts troubleshoot your studen’ts code.</li>
        <li>Warning: SO has a policy to not help with homework. So, as the teacher, you will need to post the code (with your students’ help).</li>
    </ul>
