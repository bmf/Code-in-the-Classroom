    <h3>A Screen Full of Metaphors</h3>

    <p>We are all familiar with the numerous icons representing our many installed softwares, but how often do we think about what these images represent? The paper folders for file locations, cogs and gears for settings, postal envelopes for electronic mail, moving picture film for video, old-fashioned phones, briefcases, and other symbols are all metaphors taken from our physical world to signify algorithms and information architectures that are, when taken in their entirety, incomprehensible in their complexity to the human mind.</p>

    <h2>Guy Steele: Computers are Too Complex to Know it All</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I guess to me the biggest change is that nowadays you can't possibly know everything that's going on in the computer. There are things that are absolutely out of your control because it's impossible to know everything about all the software. Back in the '7Os a computer had only 4,000 words of memory. It was possible to do a core dump and inspect every word to see if it was what you expected. It was reasonable to read the source listings of tine operating system and see how that worked. And I did that—I studied the disk routines and the card-reader routines and wrote variants of my own. I felt as if I understood how die entire IBM 1130 worked. Or at least as much as I cared to know. You just can't do that anymore.</p>

    <h2>Turing's Two Great Insights</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Alan Turing, the father of the modern computer, began by thinking about the highly conscious and deliberate step-by-step calculations performed by human “computers” like the women decoding German ciphers at Bletchley Park. His first great insight was that the same processes could be instantiated in an entirely unconscious machine, with the same results. A machine could rationally decode the German ciphers using the same steps that the conscious “computers” went through. And the unconscious relay-and-vacuum-tube computers could get to the right answers in the same way the flesh-and-blood ones could.</p>

    <h2>Ada Lovelace Describes the Analytical Engine</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The distinctive characteristic of the Analytical Engine, and that which has rendered it possible to endow mechanism with such extensive faculties as bid fair to make this engine the executive right-hand of abstract algebra, is the introduction into it of the principle which Jacquard devised for regulating, by means of punched cards, the most complicated pattems in the fabrication of brocaded stuffs. It is in this that the distinction between the two engines lies. Nothing of the sort exists in the Difference Engine. We may say most aptly, that the Analytical Engine <em>weaves algebraical patterns</em> just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves .... In enabling mechanisms to combine together <em>general</em> symbols in successions of unlimited variety and extent, a uniting link is established between the operations of matter and the abstract mental processes of the most abstract branch of mathematical science. A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have rendered possible . . .</p>
