    <h1>Our Environment</h1>

    <p>This is the most technical part of the book, and the most hands-on. Here's a brief overview of what we are going to do. If you can't do any of the following steps or don't know what the step is talking about, please skip to the next chapter "Relying On Your Digital Natives" and then return to this chapter with a student to chaperone you. The world of Information Technology is vast and complex. We should all approach the subject with humility. There is <b>no shame</b> in not knowing how to perform any of the following:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Navigate to a website.</li>
      <li>Download a ZIP file.</li>
      <li>Extract that file.</li>
      <li>Open one of the extracted files in a text editor (ie. notepad).</li>
      <li>Open that file in a web browser (ie. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I will try to be as detailed as possible in these steps. So you might want to give it a try. <b>Remember:</b> There is no shame in not knowing how to do any of these things, only shame in being afraid to admit you don't know or being unwilling to ask for help.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Acronyms acronyms, recursive acronyms (GNU)</li>
        <li>HTML, JavaScript, CSS is all you need.</li>
        <li>Why JavaScript?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Universally accessible: students can see your interactives on a phone, PC, or tablet.</li>
            <li>Lowest bar to entry: no complex setup. you literally edit a file in any text editor and open it in a browser window to see the result.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is safe: it’s used everywhere, every single website on the internet uses javascript. It’s totally secure. There is no way to do anything malicious with it.</li>
            <li>You can do almost anything with it. Draw pictures with HTML canvas. Perform math equations. Manipulate the DOM.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Security: won't do funny things to your computer</li>
        <li>Your browser is your development environment.</li>
        <li>Your IDE is a text editor (code coloring).</li>
        <li>Transparency: View-source on anything in the web to see how they did it.</li>
        <li>Disadvantage: cross-browser compatibility.</li>
    </ul>
